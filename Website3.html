      <p>The state wrestling plaque is one of the biggest accomplishments in
      high school since it is so hard to come by unless you are one of the best.
      I have came close to it but not close enough. This one you come by from Wrestling
      through your season to wrestle at sectionals there you have to place top 4
      to move on. After, sectionals comes districts there have to wrestle to also
      place top four. Then you are at state so you wrestle your way to the top one.</p>

          <p>This is a pitcure of Bishop Hartley winning the division four state football
            trophy. You get there by having a good or decent record for your team that
            year and going into the state playoffs winning your way through that. </p>

      <h3>Rugby National Trophy</h3>
      <img class="responsive" src="https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fresources.world.rugby%2Fworldrugby%2Fphoto%2F2019%2F02%2F04%2F83c3c85c-0878-4291-b346-707a05ac6e8a%2FRWC-Trophy-Tour-Germany-.jpg&imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rugbyworldcup.com%2Fnews%2F395958&docid=lYKtGGtuZPI2BM&tbnid=JtJJj3bENh8uhM%3A&vet=10ahUKEwim4-aI27jmAhUDj54KHW0KDYQQMwhHKAYwBg..i&w=1800&h=1125&hl=en&safe=active&bih=922&biw=952&q=rugby%20national%20trophy&ved=0ahUKEwim4-aI27jmAhUDj54KHW0KDYQQMwhHKAYwBg&iact=mrc&uact=8"
      alt="Rugby practice">
        <p>This is the National Rugby trophy much like football it goes through
        a record system to the playoffs. But with rugby the playoffs are called
      a tournatment instead where the most elite play. There are not many teams
      that make it to this stage in their year but the ones that do have elite
    players and very strong team chemistry. </p>

          <img class="responsive" src="https://media.arkansasonline.com/img/photos/2019/04/03/191532168_PowerLifters_ORIG_t800.jpg?90232451fbcadccc64a17de7521d859a8f88077d"
          alt="Powerlifting">
          <p> With Powerlifting It is lift wrestling mostly they do tournaments
          to see who can lift the most weight properly. An with the winning of
        the tournament depending on how big it is you could either get a medal or
      a trophy just depending on how much the competition is worth. </p>
