      alt="Wrestling practice" >
      <p>Wrestling requires intensive training with conditioning and muscle
        endurance. This also takes a lot of flexibility for instances that you need
      to get out of a certain move or hit a funky reversal. Also, you need to know
    how to maintain your eating habits so that you can stay in the weight class
  you would like</p>

          alt="Powerlifting" >
          <p> Powerlifting train with weights mostly doing reps to have muscle
               endurance but then hit maxes that take a lot of strength.This also
             has to do with a meal plan so that you are able to repair torn muslces
           and help them grow bigger.</p>
