      alt="Wrestling practice" style="width:300px;height:200px;">
      <p>Wrestling requires intensive training with conditioning and muscle
        endurance. This also takes a lot of flexibility for instances that you need
      to get out of a certain move or hit a funky reversal. Also, you need to know
    how to maintain your eating habits so that you can stay in the weight class
  you would like</p>

      alt="Football practice" style="width:300px;height:200px;">
      <p>Football is a sport that takes considerable time to train with the
        certain positions might train differently like lineman will practice more
         contact at short bursts. While a wide receiver will practice catching
         and routes.</p>

      alt="Rugby practice" style="width:300px;height:200px;">
        <p>Rugby is a different story entirely like wrestling you need a lot
          of endurance for this game and strength if you donâ€™t have those then
          man you are going to have a tough time.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Powerlifting</h3>
          <img src="http://ironsoulgym.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/DSC04353e.jpg"
          alt="Powerlifting" style="width:300px;height:200px;">
          <p> Powerlifting train with weights mostly doing reps to have muscle
               endurance but then hit maxes that take a lot of strength.This also
             has to do with a meal plan so that you are able to repair torn muslces
           and help them grow bigger.</p>
