    <p>The way sports are played for that there aren't so many injuries to happen
      and so everyone could play.I want to see more people play sports but know
      the dangers. You'll learn about me and my experiences with these sports. </p>
 
  <h2>About Me </h2>
  <p>I am Myers Slebo Jr. I play football, wrestle, and rubgy these are sports
  I love and enjoy to play. These sports take rigorous training and dedication
  it is not easy to just go out to play these sports. They have plenty of rewards
  but also have plenty of dangers that come with playing them from little sprains
  to complete tears with ligaments or concussions. I have experienced many of
  these inuries myself such as concussions, broken bones, sprains, and torn
  ligaments. I do not want people to be afraid of laying these sports because
  they are pretty fun and have a lot going for you if you can get really good
  at them. So I will discuss all the time, effort, and discipline.
